# Miri memory safety validation script
# 
# Miri is an interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate representation (MIR).
# It can detect undefined behavior in Rust code, including:
# - Out-of-bounds memory accesses
# - Use-after-free
# - Invalid pointer operations
# - Data races (in concurrent code)
#
# Usage: ./scripts/miri.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   rustup component add miri
#   cargo miri setup
